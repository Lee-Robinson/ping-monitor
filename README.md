```bash
ls -la
# Shows: ping_drops.log, ping_report.html, plus original files
```

### Running in Background (Linux/macOS)
```bash
# Run in background with output logging
nohup python3 ping_monitor.py > monitor_output.log 2>&1 &

# Check process
ps aux | grep ping_monitor
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Permission Issues
Some systems require elevated privileges:
```bash
